## Kaitlyn Crowley Monroe Freshman Summer Research

Hello, my name is Kaitlyn Crowley. I am a rising sophomore at the College of William and Mary and I am majoring in Data Science and Sociology. This summer, I am working on a research project investigating the use of Demographic Health Survey Data and the ways that machine learning and geospatial data can suppement this information. For this project, I intend to focus on Liberia and more specifically on the implications that this information can have on improving access to education. As the current COVID-19 pandemic and the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa have demonstrated, it is essential to be able to measure education access as accurately as possible. Access to education has such significant implications for the future wellbeing of the students, particularly female students in developing countries.
