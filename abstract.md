## Measuring Education

	The COVID-19 pandemic has led to drastic changes in almost every part of life for everyone around the world. As a student, one of the most significant changes that can be seen is in education. In places such as the United States, many inequalities have been brought into brighter light by the pandemic, especially when it comes to access to remote learning and an environment that is conducive to learning. However, in developing countries, these inequalities are likely to be even more severe. Some of the main indicators of inequality are wealth, geographic location, and gender. It is essential that children in developing countries are given opportunities to access an education, but in the midst of a disruption like the COVID-19 pandemic, these disruptions can often be difficult to identify and measure.
	COVID-19 is not the only public health emergency that has occurred in recent years. Ebola was another pandemic that had drastic implications for the interruption of education. Liberia is one of the countries that was impacted by the Ebola outbreak from 2014-2016 and is currently impacted by COVID-19, while not at as severe a scale as countries such as the United States. Liberia is also a country where gender inequality is a significant issue, adding even more weight to the importance of education as a method of providing girls with a way to improve their opportunities for their futures. 
	While census data provides broad information surrounding the issue of access to education, surveys such as the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) provide data that is collected more frequently. However, as the Ebola outbreak and the COVID-19 pandemic have demonstrated, changes in the circumstances of countries can change much more rapidly than a survey conducted every 5 years can account for. It is therefore essential to develop and utilize technologies to predict variables such as access to education within a frictionless pathway. 
	Hierarchical Bayesian models have the potential to be used to extrapolate the data collected in the DHS surveys to predict more current conditions. In addition to this, satellite data presents the possibility of having live information that can be analyzed to see whether schools are actively being utilized. While both of these methods show promise, one of the major drawbacks is the fact that the data collected and analyzed is difficult to disaggregate by gender. In order to fully address the issues of access to education, this gap in the technology must also be addressed in future research.
